## Knowledge and Analysis Areas

### 1. **Insurance Terminologies**
To build a strong foundation in insurance analytics, review key insurance terms:

### 2. **A/B Hypothesis Testing**
Learn about the benefits of A/B hypothesis testing for statistical decision-making. Perform hypothesis testing on the following null hypotheses:

#### Hypotheses to Test:
1. **Province Risk Analysis**:  
   - *Null Hypothesis*: There are no risk differences across provinces.
   
2. **Zipcode Risk Analysis**:  
   - *Null Hypothesis*: There are no risk differences between zip codes.

3. **Margin Analysis**:  
   - *Null Hypothesis*: There are no significant margin (profit) differences between zip codes.

4. **Gender-Based Risk Analysis**:  
   - *Null Hypothesis*: There are no significant risk differences between women and men.

### 3. **Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling**

#### Tasks:
1. **Linear Regression**:
   - For each zipcode, fit a linear regression model to predict total claims.

2. **Predictive Machine Learning Model**:
   - Develop a machine learning model to predict optimal premium values using:
     - **Features About the Car** (e.g., make, model, year).
     - **Features About the Owner** (e.g., age, gender, driving history).
     - **Features About the Location** (e.g., province, urban vs. rural).
     - **Other Relevant Features**.

3. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Report on the explaining power of the most important features that influence the predictive model.
