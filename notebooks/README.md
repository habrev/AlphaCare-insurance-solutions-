# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Version Control (DVC)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on insurance data and implements Data Version Control (DVC) for dataset management.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Steps
1. **Data Summarization**
   - Calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical features like `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaim`.
   - Review data types to ensure proper formatting of categorical variables, dates, etc.

2. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Check for missing values using heatmaps and summary statistics.

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Plot histograms for numerical variables to understand their distributions.
   - Use bar charts for categorical variables like `InsuranceCoverType` and `AutoMake`.

4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**
   - Explore correlations between `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaim`.
   - Use scatter plots to analyze relationships segmented by `ZipCode`.
   - Visualize trends across geographic regions (e.g., changes in insurance cover types).

5. **Outlier Detection**
   - Create box plots to identify outliers in numerical data.

### Key Visualizations
1. **Histogram of TotalPremium**: Shows the distribution of premiums across policies.
2. **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlights relationships between numerical variables.
3. **Trend Line for Insurance Cover Types by Geography**: Visualizes changes in insurance types over time and regions.
